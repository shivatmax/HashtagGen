##  Overview

HashtagGen is an AI-driven web application designed to generate relevant hashtags for images by utilizing advanced generative AI, language processing techniques, and vision APIs. It streamlines the process of creating engaging tags for social media content, leveraging the power of AI tools like Langchain and CrewAI to interpret visuals and suggest optimal hashtags that resonate with the target audience, thus enhancing online visibility and interaction. With its easy-to-use interface and the integration of environmental management and web search capabilities, HashtagGen serves as a valuable tool for marketers, social media managers, and content creators seeking to maximize their digital presence.

##  Features

|    | Feature           | Description                                                          |
|----|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  | The project showcases a blend of AI and web technologies, primarily intended as a Streamlit application leveraging generative AI to produce hashtags. |
| üî© | **Code Quality**  | Code style and quality metrics cannot be directly assessed without specific benchmarks or code analysis outputs. Assuming best practices given the description. |
| üìÑ | **Documentation** | The repository includes a requirements.txt and inline documentation, which are the bare minimum; comprehensive documentation may not be present. |
| üîå | **Integrations**  | Integrations include AI & vision APIs for keyword generation and Streamlit for the web interface, indicating a web-based AI application. |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | With separate configuration (`requirements.txt`) and execution (`app.py`) files, the project suggests a degree of modularity, potentially allowing for reuse and expansion. |
| üß™ | **Testing**       | No explicit mention of testing frameworks or tools; project may lack formalized testing. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**   | Performance metrics are not described; efficiency will depend on underlying APIs' response times and the optimization of the app itself. |
| üõ°Ô∏è | **Security**      | Without explicit security measures detailed, the project may rely on the inherent security features of the integrated APIs and frameworks. |
| üì¶ | **Dependencies**  | Key dependencies include `google-generativeai`, `duckduckgo_search`, `langchain-google-genai`, `langchain_community`, `crewai`, and `streamlit`, providing a mix of AI, search, and web app capabilities. |
| üöÄ | **Scalability**   | The scalability largely relies on the performance of the infrastructures like Google AI services and how well Streamlit handles concurrent users; not assessed directly. |
